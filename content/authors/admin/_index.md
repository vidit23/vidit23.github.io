I am a backend engineer with a keen interest in building a bridge between Computer Science, Business, and Consumer Psychology. 

I grew up in Dubai, completed my undergrad in India, and currently, I am living in New York pursuing my Master's at NYU. 

In my free time, you can catch me cooking, baking (my cookies have a notorious habit of coming out as cakes) or walking around the city. 

<!-- Having lived in such diverse countries, I carry seen technology trancend socio-economic barriers in such diverse countries, I believe it holds the power to bring far-reaching change. I like to identify pain points and construct creative solutions.  -->
