I always wanted to build my own website. My first attempt in sixth grade looked like [this](https://viditcool.weebly.com/). Needless to say, I have learnt quite a bit about web development since then. However, I had been putting it off not realizing the importance of having a medium to channel my thoughts. 

I was told to ask my friends and family five words that come to their head when they think of me and use those adjective to build my own theme for this website (and give myself a reality check). Here are my takeaways:
* I am going to list down why and how I came up with the idea for all my posts and projects to showcase creativity and innovation
* I am going to make a post each time I find something exciting to keep my child like wonder.
* I will try to be humble since so many people think I am intelligent.
* Impatient, Stubborn and Bossy: I am working on it :p

As for the cool things in this website. 
Each post can be easily shared with the social media icons at the bottom of each page. While sharing, it has information in the meta tags to display the title, the image and a small summary, which also helps with SEO. Moreoever, I was able to build in Google Analytics so I can stalk my stalkers in realtime.
